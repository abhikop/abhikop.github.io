Hi! I am a third year PhD student at UT Austin. My advisor is <a href='https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/sampayne/'>Sam Payne</a>. Before UT I was an undergraduate at <a href='https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/'>IISER Pune</a>. Here is my [CV](/assets/CV_Abhishek_Koparde.pdf).

I am broadly interested in the interplay between point counting techniques and algebraic geometry.
